# Integrated-Capstone---Sorting-Performance-Analyzer
Integrated Capstone - Sorting Performance Analyzer to Implement a core Data Structure concept, enhance it using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), simulate hardware behavior based on Computer Organization, analyze performance using Probability &amp; Statistics, and identify two real-world applications.
# Algorithm Performance Analyzer 🚀

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of fundamental sorting algorithms by integrating concepts from **Data Structures**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Computer Organization**, and **Statistics**. It demonstrates how algorithm performance is influenced not just by its theoretical complexity, but also by the underlying hardware and the structure of the code itself.

## 📌 Key Concepts Covered

* **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Implementation and analysis of classic sorting algorithms.
* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Using inheritance and polymorphism to create a scalable and modular design.
* **Computer Organization:** Simulating different CPU models to measure the impact of hardware speed.
* **Probability & Statistics:** Applying statistical methods to ensure reliable and meaningful performance results.

---

## ✨ Features

* **CPU Simulation:** Simulates multiple CPU types (`Basic`, `Mid`, `Pro`) with varying operational delays to model real-world hardware differences.
* **OOP Design:** Employs an abstract base class for algorithms, allowing new sorting methods to be added with minimal effort.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Runs multiple trials for each test case to calculate the **mean** and **standard deviation** of execution times, providing a clear picture of an algorithm's speed and consistency.
* **Data Generation:** Generates input arrays using random distributions for unbiased testing.

## 🧪 Algorithms Implemented

* **Bubble Sort** - Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$
* **Merge Sort** - Time Complexity: $O(n \log n)$
* **Quick Sort** - Time Complexity: $O(n \log n)$ on average, $O(n^2)$ in the worst case.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** **Python 3** (The OOP design is language-agnostic and can be implemented in Java, C++, etc.)
* **Libraries:**
    * **NumPy:** For efficient numerical operations and data generation.
    * **Matplotlib:** For visualizing the analysis results.
